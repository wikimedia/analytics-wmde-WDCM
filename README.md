Wikidata Concept Monitor

The Wikidata Concepts Monitor (WDCM) (aka: Q42376073) is an analytical tool that enables you to browse and build an understanding of the way Wikidata is used across the Wikimedia projects.

While Wikidata itself is a semantic ontology with pre-defined and evolving normative rules of description and inference, Wikidata usage is essentialy a social, behavioral phenomenon, suitable for study by means of machine learning in the field of distributional semantics: the analysis and modeling of statistical patterns of occurrence and co-occurence of Wikidata item and property usage across the client projects (e.g. enwiki, frwiki, ruwiki, etc). 

WDCM thus employs various statistical methodologies in an attempt to describe and provide insights from the observable Wikidata usage statistics (e.g. topic modeling, clustering, dimensionality reduction, all beyond providing elementary descriptive statistics of Wikidata usage, of course.).

The WDCM is designed to become a path towards discovery: following the examples listed here not only that you can learn to work with a system that might improve your understanding of Wikidata, but you could also find yourself involved in adventurous attempts to learn and discover more of it.
